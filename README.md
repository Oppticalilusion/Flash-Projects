Project was created through Flash during my time at St. Lawrence(2017). A re-creation of one of my first ever games made during my courses in high school.

2 Players each control a single paddle and battle to knock the pong ball through the back of their opponents net.

------ Numbers Game ------
Demo96.swf

Created at SLC (2017) as the first flash assignment.

Using the A & D keys, move left and right to collect the falling numbers. Choose wisely to watch the goal at the bottom.
Avoid bombs as you will lose 5 points. The alien will end the game. Instructions are linked from the main title screen.

Uses a range of different teachings to provide a small, but complex flash game.
